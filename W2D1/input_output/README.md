# Working with Files
For today's exercise, work through the example exercises on this page:

[Bastard's Book of Ruby: File Input/Output](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/io/)

Don't just copy/paste the exercises and call it 'done'. Look at what is happening, understand the examples, and take the time to research and realize what the different file modes do, as well as how Ruby uses commands such as puts and gets in conjunction with files to set and get information from the contents of a file.

This will be important in later exercises today.

# NOTE: SKIP the Google Chart exercise at the end.
